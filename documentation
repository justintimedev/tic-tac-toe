### CSS Styles:
The CSS styles define the appearance of the game, scoreboard, and buttons.

- Styling for the game board, cells, and hover effect.
- Styling for the scoreboard, including scores, average scores, and total games.
- Styling for the reset buttons.

### JavaScript Logic:
The JavaScript code provides the functionality of the Tic Tac Toe game.

- Variables to keep track of the game state, current player, scores, average scores, and total games.
- Function to handle cell click event and mark the cell with the current player's symbol.
- Function to check for a win or draw.
- Functions to update the scores and average scores.
- Function to reset the game and scores.
- Event listeners for cell clicks, reset button clicks, and reset score button clicks.

### Game Initialization:
- Variables are initialized to store the scores, average scores, and total games retrieved from `localStorage`.
- Event listener is added to handle the page load event and update the scores, average scores, and total games on the scoreboard.

### Score and Average Calculation:
- The `updateScore()` function is called when a player wins a game to update the scores and `localStorage`.
- The `updateAverage()` function calculates the average scores for Player X and Player O based on the total number of games and 
updates the average score elements on the scoreboard.

### Score Reset:
- Event listener is added to the reset score button to handle the click event.
- When the reset score button is clicked, the scores are set to 0, `localStorage` is updated, and the score elements on the 
scoreboard are reset to 0.

### Game Reset:
- Event listener is added to the reset button to handle the click event.
- When the

 reset button is clicked, the game board is cleared, the game state is reset, and the result message is cleared.

## Summary:
The Tic Tac Toe game implemented with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript allows two players to play the classic game on a 3x3 grid. The game 
keeps track of the scores for each player and calculates the average scores across multiple game sessions. Players can reset the 
game, reset the scores, and continue playing. The code provides a structured and interactive implementation of the Tic Tac Toe game.
